# book-inventory
Spring Boot based implementation of a minimalist book inventory app to represent a possible module architecture.
This app offers basic CRUD functionality and some search functionality for handling books via book title and author.
The book entities are persisted in an underlying SQL database (in memory) for the sake of simplicity
